# Project Database

Project Database is a first design of my social media website, designed to allow students at Cooks Hill Campus The Big Picture Educations school in Newcastle to fiind other students projects. This would allow for increased collaboration, ideas, and monitering of students projects. The new version of this design is My respository FIC.
